# Sandbox Environment

viagogo API v2 is supported in two environments. You can use our *sandbox*
environment for testing purposes, before moving to the *production*. Use your
sandbox credentials to make calls to the sandbox environment. When you're set
to go live, use your production credentials to make calls to the production
environment.
